# 09 — Known Gaps, Reserves & Current Boundaries

## Hard boundaries

- Runtime v3 **NON ADOPTED**
- This corpus does not change product behavior by itself (Living Reference is descriptive)
- PocketTasks-observed materialization / MW5 gaps are **mitigated at deterministic tested scope**; REAL OpenAI / PocketTasks parity is **not** re-proven
- ZERO REAL in PRODUCT-CYCLE-E2E-STABILIZATION-01 — no READY FOR REAL / E2E REAL / Product global READY claimed
- No CI workflow changes

## Current campaign findings (verified against repo where possible)

| Finding | Class | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Natural active-cycle materialization routing corrected (#532) | CONFIRMED | continuity tests on main |
| Artifact applicability bridge corrected (#533) | CONFIRMED | bridge helpers on HEAD |
| D-PC-09: filename candidate + server exact target; no micro-gate | CONFIRMED (doc) | product-completion cadrage amendment |
| REAL PocketTasks asked Pilot for filename | OBSERVATION | campaign UX; REAL not re-run here |
| Fake may derive `note-de-cadrage.md`; REAL may leave null | MITIGATED Fake / REAL still provider-dependent | Fake now uses provider-neutral leaf cues; REAL not re-run |
| MW5 may re-challenge structurally resolved continuation | MITIGATED at tested scope | `structurallyResolvedActiveCycleContinuation` |
| Local tests pre-satisfy challenge assessment | MITIGATED on materialization Fake path | default assessment null |
| E2E backbone can bypass natural conversation front door | MITIGATED at tested scope — Product server-action oracle | `productCycleE2eStabilization.frontDoor.d0.test.ts` |
| Pending Proposal / reinstruction continuity = downstream impact seam | CONFIRMED structural | process-local proposalStore |
| EC→Attempt→Evidence→Recovery single lineage needs re-proof | RE-PROVEN AT TESTED SCOPE (Fake) | front-door oracle |

## Uncertainties

- Dependency graph is representative, not exhaustive of every file.
- Failure-mode catalog is selected, not every string code in repo.
- Some object cards mark PARTIAL where aggregate naming is distributed across DTOs.
- REAL OpenAI leaf candidacy parity not re-proven this macro (DETERMINISTIC only).

## Next macro

`PRODUCT-CYCLE-E2E-STABILIZATION-01` **executed** on branch `fix/sfia-studio-product-cycle-e2e-stabilization-01` (this tree). Capacité suivante: **requalifier après preuve** — ne pas auto-sélectionner.

## PRODUCT-CYCLE-E2E-STABILIZATION-01 overlay

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| G2 filename micro-gate nominal | MITIGATED — Nora leaf candidate + server compose; clarify when no cue |
| G3 MW5 gratuitous re-challenge | MITIGATED — `structurallyResolvedActiveCycleContinuation` (≠ Truth C ≠ HD) |
| G1/G8 front-door + Fake realism | MITIGATED — front-door oracle; Fake materialization assessment default null |
| G6 EC→Attempt→Evidence lineage | RE-PROVEN at tested scope via Product server-action front-door oracle (Fake docs-write + LPS outcome refs) |
| REAL / E2E REAL | NOT claimed — ZERO REAL this macro |
| Naming policy STOP | NOT required — leaf remains non-authoritative candidate (D-PC-09) |

## Legacy architecture decommission audit (this tree)

**Macro:** `SFIA-STUDIO-LEGACY-ARCHITECTURE-DECOMMISSION-01` @ `1162b36b` / merged `#535`
**Verdict:** **AUDIT COMPLETE — NO SAFE REMOVAL PROVEN** (no product code deleted).

| Candidate | Classification | Exit / why not removed |
|---|---|---|
| OPS1 (`app/ops1`, `lib/ops1`, `features/ops1`) | KEEP — TEMPORARY | Active route + D1 nav + CI `__tests__/ops1/**` + product Fake env names `OPS1_*`; exit requires Morris GO + env rename + suite/nav cutover |
| `lib/oa/execution-run/**` | KEEP — TEMPORARY | Not on product spine, but FinOps/T7 shadow + CI suite + vol coupling; FinOps HORS SCOPE blocks clean delete |
| `/cycle-actif`, `/decision`, `/synthese` (+ features) | RETIRE FROM ACTIVE VISIBILITY (partial) + KEEP — TEMPORARY | Historical nav tier done; `/`→`/synthese`, 404, FLUSH_TABS, increment/p0 tests remain |
| D1 routes / `lib/d1` | KEEP — CURRENT / ADAPT | Active intake surfaces |
| F3 / W3A fixtures | KEEP — CURRENT (test substitute) | Wired in `vertical-slice-runtime/service.ts` |
| FinOps / T7 | HORS SCOPE | Frozen — do not touch |
| `sfia-v3-modeled/**` | HORS SCOPE | Required Gate CI |

No `retired-components-ledger.md` — zero components removed.
